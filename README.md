CSCE 676 — Data Mining Project
Market Basket Analysis & Sampling-Based Apriori Study

This project explores transaction data using exploratory data analysis (EDA), basket statistics, sparsity analysis, and association rule mining. The focus is on understanding how sampling and support thresholds impact Apriori rule discovery and frequent itemset generation.

The notebook contains a full workflow from behavioral feature engineering to scalable association mining experiments.

## Project Goals

Perform transaction-level EDA

Analyze basket size distribution

Measure item co-occurrence sparsity

Build item co-occurrence counts

Implement Apriori on binary basket matrix

Implement random sampling Apriori

Study how sampling fraction (alpha) affects:

number of rules

number of frequent itemsets

Derive behavioral features (gender purchase dominance)

Formulate research questions from EDA findings

## Methods Used

pandas

numpy

matplotlib

Apriori (custom implementation)

Random sampling Apriori

Co-occurrence counting

Sparsity measurement

Feature engineering
