    "\n",
    "Reason:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Directly supports recommendation system modeling through large-scale implicit user–item interaction data, aligning with course topics such as frequent itemsets, clustering, and graph mining.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Naturally enables graph-based analysis, where user–item interactions can be represented as a bipartite graph, allowing the use of GraphX and other graph mining techniques covered in the course.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Supports beyond-course techniques including collaborative filtering, matrix factorization, session-based recommendation, and graph neural networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Provides a realistic industrial-scale setting, with highly sparse and long-tailed user–item interactions, making it suitable for studying bias, cold-start issues, and scalability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Trade-offs\n",
    "\n",
    "- No explicit target variable, requiring the recommendation task to be formulated as an implicit-feedback or ranking-based problem rather than standard supervised learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Limited natural language content, as product descriptions and reviews are minimal, restricting text-based modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Severe sparsity and popularity bias, which may favor popular items and active users unless explicitly addressed in modeling and evaluation."
